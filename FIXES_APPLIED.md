## Critical Issue: Infinite Voice Service Error Loop

### Problem Description
The system was experiencing an infinite loop in the voice service with continuous error messages:
```
❌ Unexpected error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'close'
🎤 Listening...
❌ Unexpected error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'close'
🎤 Listening...
[repeating infinitely...]
```

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Microphone Initialization Failure**: When the microphone failed to initialize properly, it was set to `None`
2. **Continuous Listening Worker**: The `_continuous_listen_worker` method continued trying to use the `None` microphone
3. **Poor Error Handling**: The specific `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'close'` error wasn't handled gracefully
4. **No Backoff Mechanism**: Failed attempts had no exponential backoff or cooldown period
5. **Error Message Spam**: Every failure printed an error message, causing console spam

### Comprehensive Fix Applied

#### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `listen_once` Method
```python
def listen_once(self, timeout: float = 5.0, suppress_output: bool = False) -> Optional[str]:
    # Added suppress_output parameter to prevent spam during continuous listening
    
    # Handle specific NoneType close errors silently
    if "'NoneType'" in error_msg and "close" in error_msg:
        self.microphone = None
        return None
    
    # Prevent error message spam in continuous mode
    if not suppress_output:
        logger.warning(f"Unexpected listening error: {e}")
```

#### 2. Robust Continuous Listening Worker
```python
def _continuous_listen_worker(self):
    microphone_failures = 0
    max_failures = 3  # Limit reinitialization attempts
    consecutive_errors = 0
    max_consecutive_errors = 5  # Faster stopping
    last_error_time = 0
    error_cooldown = 2.0  # Prevent error message spam
    
    # Enhanced error handling with specific NoneType handling
    if ("'NoneType'" in error_msg and "close" in error_msg):
        # Handle silently and disable microphone
        self.microphone = None
        time.sleep(1.0)
        continue
    
    # Progressive backoff mechanism
    backoff_time = min(0.5 + (0.3 * consecutive_errors), 2.0)
    time.sleep(backoff_time)
```

#### 3. Intelligent Microphone Reinitialization
```python
def _safe_initialize_microphone(self, quiet_mode: bool = False):
    # Added quiet_mode to prevent verbose output during reinitialization
    # Robust error handling for different microphone failure scenarios
    # Graceful fallback mechanisms
```

#### 4. Enhanced Error Logging and User Feedback
- **Error Cooldown**: Prevents spam by limiting error messages to every 2 seconds
- **Failure Limits**: Stops continuous listening after 3 microphone failures
- **Progressive Backoff**: Increases wait time between retry attempts
- **Silent Mode**: Reinitializations during continuous listening don't produce verbose output

## System Architecture Improvements

### 1. Modular Voice Service Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Voice service now handles only voice-related functionality
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation between TTS, STT, and coordination logic
- **Error Isolation**: Voice failures don't crash the entire system

### 2. Enhanced Web Search Integration
- **Multi-Engine Support**: DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, and web scraping
- **"Im Alive" Search**: Specifically tested and verified working
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when search engines are unavailable

### 3. Configuration Management
- **Intel Hardware Profiles**: Automatic detection and optimization
- **Settings Persistence**: Configuration saves and loads properly
- **Environment Adaptation**: Adapts to different hardware configurations

### 4. Testing Framework
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all components
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of voice and search workflows
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Memory and CPU usage monitoring
- **Mock Testing**: Proper mocking for external dependencies

## Key Files Modified

### `services/enhanced_voice_service.py` (Major Overhaul)
- **Lines 171-268**: Complete rewrite of `listen_once` method with robust error handling
- **Lines 285-356**: Enhanced `_continuous_listen_worker` with failure limits and backoff
- **Lines 62-118**: Updated `_safe_initialize_microphone` with quiet mode support
- **Added**: Error cooldown mechanisms, NoneType error handling, progressive backoff

### `config/settings.py` (Configuration Fixes)
